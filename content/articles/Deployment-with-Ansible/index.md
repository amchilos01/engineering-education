**Introduction**

Before the targeted end-users can use an application, it has to be deployed. [Deployment](https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/software-deployment/#:~:text=Software%20deployment%20is%20one%20of%20the%20most%20important,and%20patches%20are%20delivered%20from%20developers%20to%20users) refers to the process by which software is made available for use. Deployment can be to a single infrastructure or a wide range of infrastructures. Deployment to a single infrastructure is easily and quickly done, but as the number of infrastructures increases, so is the amount of effort and resources needed to deploy.

The consistency of the environment is also more likely to change due to higher chances of human error. Another challenge that commonly arises when an application needs to be updated is that the Updated applications become obsolete by the time the system finishes updating all the applications. Here is where [Ansible](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ansible/ansible_introduction.htm) comes to the rescue. Ansible enables us to deploy applications consistently and reliably. It allows the configuration of several systems from one single system. Application artifacts can also be easily pushed to different systems with the help of Ansible.


**What Is Ansible, how itâ€™s used**

Ansible is an open-source Information Technology (IT) software that automates application deployment and cloud provisioning, enabling computer data centers through computer-readable files rather than physical hardware configuration. Ansible runs on operating systems almost similar to [UNIX-like systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) but can also run on [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows). It includes its own declaration language, which describes system configuration. This software is sometimes agentless in which can be harnessed through remote connections via channels such as [Windows Remote Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Remote_Management) and [Secure Shell Protocol](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Secure-Shell) (SSH) to execute its functions.

Ansible works by connecting to nodes in the [Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/operating-system-tutorial.html#:~:text=Summary%201%20Define%20Operating%20System%3A%20An%20operating%20system,kernels%20are%20Monolithic%20and%20MicroKernels%20More%20items...%20) and pushes [modules]((https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3843/module#:~:text=A%20module%20is%20a%20software%20component%20or%20part,a%20programmer%27s%20job%20easy%20by%20allowing%20the%20)) into them, which then are used to complete automation tasks in Ansible. Once connected, Ansible transfers modules required by users' commands to remote machines for execution. Ansible uses humanly readable [Yet another Mark-up Language](https://yaml.org/spec/history/2001-08-01.html) (YAML), which is an easy-to-understand programming language. Ansible can be used for ad-hoc commands directly without using [Playbook](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/tip/Compare-runbooks-vs-playbooks-for-IT-process-documentation), but this has a limitation of one-time tasks. Ansible uses playbooks called [Ansible Playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html#:~:text=%20Playbook%20execution%20%C2%B6%20%201%20Task%20execution,playbook%20to%20see%20detailed%20output%20from...%20More%20) to control IT processes.

To use Ansible, one would require three main components: Ansible server, a playbook and remote hosts. Run your playbook (instructions used in configurations of cloud instances), the Ansible server will then connect with each of the cloud instance. The process of Setting up remote connectionsbetween your Ansible server and your remote hosts is as simplified as setting up a password-less login using SSH keys. Passwords may be used in cases where one cannot(or will not) use SSH keys. This however would require Ansible to prompt password either at runtime or store them in a file. This process is discouraged for two main reasons; Convenience and security reasons.

The list of tasks you want executed using Ansible will then be defined separately from the list of computers to be configured. At this point, Ansible is then provided with a standalone inventory file. of hostname.

Ansible operates using a playbook. In the playbook, you can run loops, declare variables and use conditionals. Playbooks contain sections such as "Task" sections, "Vars" sections and "handlers" sections.The task sections contain list of commands that are to be performed on the remote computers, while on the other hand handlers are specialised tasks that when signalled with a notify statement will run at the end of a play. Every task in a playbook runs its list of corresponding commands usually known as Ansible module.

E.g. if you run a push code from GitHub, you would call it Ansible git module. The task would then invoke Ansible git module, grab it from specified git URL then push it in the destination directory. The module will then clean up after itself as Ansible never caves cruft from executing the module on the server.

Ansible comes with over 500 modules. This is more than sufficient to cover most of the basic needs. Some of these modules are key in the execution of push code and configuration of files, managing docker containers, bash commands and also installation of packages among others.


**How to install Ansible in an organization**

There are various steps to be followed for the successful implementation of Ansible in organizations. Users must buy the latest Ansible software from Red Hat, which is normally released twice a year. The purchase comes with a user guide on installation, configuration, and running the software. The first step in the implementation of Ansible is the installation of the software. However, the main prerequisite that must be met before Ansible software is installed is the availability of [Python](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3533/python#:~:text=What%20Does%20Python%20Mean%3F%20Python%20is%20a%20multiparadigm%2C,almost%20as%20if%20speaking%20in%20a%20human%20language.) 2 or Python 3 in the system, which acts as a control and manage nodes. This is followed by selecting Ansible and artifact to install. This comes in two packages, namely the community package called Ansible and Ansible core. The artifact version chosen should match the user's needs. The community package is installed by using the Operating System manager of [Python package manager](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pip-python-package-manager) (PIP). However, Ansible core is installed using Python Package manager only. Once installed, Ansible and Ansible core can be upgraded if the version is 2.9 or earlier. Users need to uninstall older versions before installing new ones. Upgrading is done by uninstalling Ansible base from your OS and using Python package manager (PIP) to install Ansible core. Users should use the installation manual to install Ansible in other compatible operating systems like [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu), [Debian](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian), [Fedora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)), and [Centos](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-centos-linux-2/learning-centos). Confirmation of installation is done by using a ping command.

After successful installation of the latest Ansible software, it's followed by configuration. Configuration involves using a [configuration file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file) (Ansible.cfg) whose compatible paths should be cross-checked in reference documentation in the user manual. Users should use the latest configuration files usually coded as .rpmnew. Configuration can also be done under different environment variables. However, these normally override settings loaded in the configuration file. Users, therefore, need to check all the available environment variables from Ansible Configuration Settings.

**Merits of using Ansible in deployment**

Simplicity in the language, scalability in operations, consistency in the execution of functions, and reliability during deployment are some of the standout advantages of this software. In addition, one of the key merits of using Ansible in deployment is its ability to remove modules effectively connecting to the host machine and executes instructions without hitches. Further to this, Ansible enables IT professionals to remove codes that had been copied to the host machines without affecting the execution of functions. Ansible automation reduces downtime to zero, thus increasing efficiency in organizations enabling them to save on time and costs. Additional features of Ansible, such as security and reliability, improve organizations' efficiency and reduce online security threats. Ansible language is user-friendly, and its audibility program can be used by persons unfamiliar with the program.

**Who should use Ansible?**

With today's demand for automation of processes, consistency in customer delivery and the move toward cloud, industries in all sectors want to adopt to easy-to-use tool that would in turn enable them achieve these goals as well as overcoming complexities. Migration to Ansible is definitely one of the most ideal solutions for automating processes in an organization's modern technology challenge while enhancing performance in an essential role in app deployment which in turn improves responsiveness.

Ansible has many applications and has a broader customer base. Software developers can use Ansible as a tool for coding since it's written in a user-friendly and straightforward language and easy to understand. Also, System administrators can use Ansible to automate administration tasks, thus streamlining IT operations. Information Technology professionals use Ansible to automate IT processes that would be complex if done by humans, thus eliminating drudgery. Organizations also use Ansible in their day to day operations to cut costs, minimize errors, improve efficiency and increase profits.
